This project focuses on enhancing the energy efficiency and performance of cloud computing systems by implementing an Application Load Balancer (ALB) within an AWS environment. By distributing traffic evenly across multiple EC2 instances deployed in a public subnet of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), the system ensures improved performance, scalability, and redundancy. The project involves setting up essential components such as VPCs, subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and EC2 instances, followed by configuring target groups and listener rules for the ALB. This setup not only optimizes resource usage but also demonstrates best practices in cloud networking for cost efficiency and high availability.
